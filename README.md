Getting started

See docs/setup for environment setup and verification scripts:

- `docs/setup/wsl-setup.md`
- `docs/setup/postgres-wsl.md`
- `dev/setup_python.sh`
- `dev/setup_node.sh`
- `dev/verify_env.sh`

Run `./dev/verify_env.sh` in your WSL distro to validate basic environment and Postgres TCP reachability.
