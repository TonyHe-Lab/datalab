title: "Story 1.1: WSL Python 3.12 & Node Environment Setup"
epic: 1

## Story

**As a** developer (local/CI),
**I want** a reproducible WSL 2 development environment with Python 3.12 and Node.js configured,
**so that** contributors can run and develop the project consistently and CI pipelines can execute reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria

The acceptance criteria below are written to be directly verifiable; each item includes explicit validation steps and a clear pass condition.

AC-1: WSL2 setup documentation
- Validation steps: On a clean Windows machine with WSL installed, follow `docs/setup/wsl-setup.md` and run `wsl -l -v` (on Windows) or `uname -r` (inside the distro).
- Pass condition: `wsl -l -v` shows the distro using version 2 or `uname -r` shows a WSL2-compatible kernel. The documented steps complete without missing required actions.

AC-2: Python 3.12 and virtualenv workflow
- Validation steps: In WSL, follow `dev/setup_python.sh` or the documented steps to install Python 3.12. Create a virtual environment with `python -m venv .venv`, activate it and run `python --version` and `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or `pip install` for the example packages).
- Pass condition: `python --version` prints `Python 3.12.x` and `pip install` completes with exit code 0. `pip freeze` includes the expected sample packages listed in the story or repo.

AC-3: Node.js LTS and package manager
- Validation steps: In WSL, install Node LTS per `dev/setup_node.sh` or docs, then run `node --version` and `pnpm --version` (or `npm --version`/`yarn --version` if preferred). Run `pnpm install` (or `npm ci`) against a minimal `package.json` provided in the repo.
- Pass condition: `node --version` returns a v20.x LTS string, the chosen package manager returns a version and `pnpm install`/`npm ci` exits with code 0.

AC-4: Postgres reachability from WSL (TCP-level verification)
- Validation steps: Using `dev/verify_postgres_connection.py` (or `nc`/`telnet`) from inside WSL, attempt a TCP connection to the configured `$POSTGRES_HOST:$POSTGRES_PORT` and, if credentials are provided, attempt an auth check using the same credentials the app will use.
- Pass condition: TCP connect returns success (exit code 0). If credentials are supplied, the script should indicate whether authentication succeeded or failed with an explicit, machine-readable exit code (0 success, >0 failure). Full Windows-host-side configuration changes (pg_hba.conf, firewall) remain in Story 1.2; this story must document the verification steps and expected outputs.

AC-5: Minimal verification script and CI integration
- Validation steps: `dev/verify_env.sh` runs locally and as a `workflow_dispatch` job in GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/env-verify.yml`) using repository secrets for POSTGRES_* values. The script must check for required binaries (python, node, pnpm/npm, nc/python) and exit non-zero on unmet checks.
- Pass condition: `dev/verify_env.sh` exits with code 0 locally when environment is correct; the same script run in GitHub Actions (using secrets) completes with a success status. When a required check fails, the script exits non-zero and prints actionable diagnostics.

AC-6: Security & secrets handling
- Validation steps: Documentation must include a `.env` usage example and instructions to configure GitHub Secrets. Confirm `.gitignore` includes `.env` (or create/update it if missing).
- Pass condition: `.env` is listed in `.gitignore` and the docs explain how to populate secrets locally and in CI without committing credentials.

Recommended concrete defaults (add to story to avoid ambiguity):

- Python: 3.12.x (use `>=3.12,<3.13` in tooling)
- Node: LTS 20.x
- Preferred package manager: `pnpm` (recommendation) — adjust to org preference if different
- Required env vars for subsequent stories: `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `DATABASE_URL`

## Dev Notes

Previous Story Insights:
- No previous dev-agent records exist. This is the first story in Epic 1. [Source: docs/prd_shards/05-epics.md#Epic-1]

Data / Tech Stack Guidance:
- Follow the project's tech stack and coding standards for tooling versions and workflows. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Respect source tree and file locations when creating setup scripts and docs. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

Environment & Project Structure:
- Place environment setup documentation and scripts under `dev/` and `docs/setup/` per source-tree guidance. If those folders do not exist, create `dev/` for scripts and `docs/setup/` for user-facing instructions. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

Auth / Security / Constraints:
- Do not commit secrets. Instruct use of `.env` files and add `.env` to `.gitignore`. Follow security guidelines in `docs/prd_shards/12-security.md` for any credentials handling. [Source: docs/prd_shards/12-security.md]

Testing / Validation:
- Include a small `verify_env.sh` (or PowerShell equivalent) that checks installed versions and attempts a TCP connection to the configured Postgres host/port. Add unit-like checks as shell exit codes for CI consumption. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md (if present) or docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

If specific guidance is missing:
- No explicit WSL setup steps found in architecture docs; instructions must be explicit and reproduceable in this story. [Source: docs/prd_shards/05-epics.md]

## Tasks / Subtasks
 
- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1,5) — Create reproducible WSL 2 setup instructions
  - [x] Draft `docs/setup/wsl-setup.md` with step-by-step commands for enabling WSL2, installing distro, and kernel updates. [Source: docs/prd_shards/05-epics.md]

Minimal `dev/verify_env.sh` (suggested content):

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
python --version
node --version
pnpm --version || npm --version
echo "ENV VARS: POSTGRES_HOST=${POSTGRES_HOST:-unset} POSTGRES_PORT=${POSTGRES_PORT:-unset}"
# Optional: attempt TCP connect to POSTGRES_HOST:POSTGRES_PORT (requires nc)
if command -v nc >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  nc -zv ${POSTGRES_HOST:-localhost} ${POSTGRES_PORT:-5432} || true
fi
echo "verify_env completed"
```

Minimal GitHub Actions snippet for CI (suggested):

```yaml
name: Env Verify
on: [workflow_dispatch]
jobs:
  verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run env verify
        run: ./dev/verify_env.sh
        env:
          POSTGRES_HOST: ${{ secrets.POSTGRES_HOST }}
          POSTGRES_PORT: ${{ secrets.POSTGRES_PORT }}
```
