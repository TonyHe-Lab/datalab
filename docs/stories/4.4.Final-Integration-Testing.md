## Story

**As a** quality assurance engineer,
**I want** comprehensive end-to-end integration testing,
**so that** the complete system works correctly from frontend to backend with real data flows.

## Acceptance Criteria

AC-1: End-to-end workflow testing
- Validation steps: Test complete user journey from fault entry to diagnosis
- Pass condition: All components work together correctly

AC-2: API integration validation
- Validation steps: Verify all frontend-backend API connections
- Pass condition: Data flows correctly between all layers

AC-3: Error handling and edge cases
- Validation steps: Test error scenarios and boundary conditions
- Pass condition: System handles errors gracefully

AC-4: Performance testing
- Validation steps: Measure response times and identify bottlenecks
- Pass condition: System meets performance requirements

AC-5: Cross-browser compatibility
- Validation steps: Test application in different browsers
- Pass condition: Consistent behavior across supported browsers

### Data Models
Complete system data flow:
- User input → Frontend → API → Backend → Database → AI Service → Response [Source: docs/architecture.md]
- Real medical work order data from production-like datasets
- Mock data for testing edge cases and error scenarios

### API Specifications
Full API integration testing:
- All endpoints from Epic 3: /api/chat, /api/search, /api/analytics/* [Source: docs/stories/3.1-3.4]
- Authentication and authorization (if implemented)
- Rate limiting and request validation
- WebSocket/real-time updates (if applicable)
