## Story

**As a** frontend developer,
**I want** to set up a React application with Ant Design and Vite,
**so that** I can build the user interface for the medical work order analysis system.

## Acceptance Criteria

AC-1: Vite project setup
- Validation steps: Create React 18 + TypeScript project using Vite
- Pass condition: Project builds successfully and runs in development mode

AC-2: Ant Design integration
- Validation steps: Install and configure Ant Design with theme customization
- Pass condition: Ant Design components render correctly with custom theme

AC-3: Project structure
- Validation steps: Create organized folder structure for components, pages, services
- Pass condition: Structure follows monorepo conventions and is scalable

AC-4: Development tooling
- Validation steps: Configure ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript for code quality
- Pass condition: Code formatting and linting work correctly

AC-5: Basic routing setup
- Validation steps: Implement react-router-dom with basic route structure
- Pass condition: Navigation between pages works correctly

- Story 3.3: RAG chat endpoint for diagnostic queries [Source: docs/stories/3.3.RAG-Chat-Endpoint-Implementation.md]
- Story 3.4: Analytics endpoints for dashboard data [Source: docs/stories/3.4.Analytics-SQL-Views-Endpoints.md]

### Data Models
From frontend specification:
- API response structures for chat and analytics endpoints [Source: docs/frontend-spe.md#6-api-集成层-service-layer]
- Mock data structure for medical work orders [Source: docs/UX Master Prompt.md#Deliverables]
- TypeScript interfaces for API responses

### API Specifications
From frontend specification:
- `/api/chat` endpoint for diagnostic queries [Source: docs/frontend-spe.md#6-api-集成层-service-layer]
- `/api/dashboard` endpoint for analytics data [Source: docs/frontend-spe.md#6-api-集成层-service-layer]
- Axios configuration with baseURL: '/api' [Source: docs/frontend-spe.md#6-api-集成层-service-layer]
- React Query for server state management [Source: docs/frontend-spe.md#4-状态管理与数据流-state-management]

### File Locations
Based on monorepo structure:
- `frontend/` - Root directory for frontend application
- `frontend/package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `frontend/vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration
- `frontend/src/main.tsx` - Application entry point
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Main application component
- `frontend/src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `frontend/src/pages/` - Page components
- `frontend/src/services/` - API service layer
- `frontend/src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions

### Testing Requirements
From architecture.md testing strategy:
- Unit tests for React components
- Integration tests for API services
- UI component testing with testing-library
- TypeScript type checking
- Accessibility testing

### Technical Constraints
- React 18 with Vite build tool [Source: docs/UX Master Prompt.md#Technical-Constraints]
- Ant Design 5.x for UI components [Source: docs/UX Master Prompt.md#Technical-Constraints]
- TypeScript for type safety [Source: docs/UX Master Prompt.md#Technical-Constraints]
- Monorepo structure with `/frontend` directory [Source: docs/prd.md#42-code-organization]
- Compact design with high information density [Source: docs/UX Master Prompt.md#Theme-&-Styling]
